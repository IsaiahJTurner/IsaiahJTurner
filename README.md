# Flappy Block

## About

This is an iOS verion of the "smash hit" Flappy Bird built using iOS7's physics
engine.  Since  Dong Nguyen took the game down, I wanted to see how hard
it would acutally be to create the game. This is the __No Mercy Edition__ so
when you lose you have to quit the game which adds an extra level of annoyance.
to an already annoying game. This was made only as an excercise for using the 
physics engine. Good luck and have fun.
