## About

I wish I was not in school while I was working on this. Jony Ive would not be happy about my lack of blur, skeuomorphism (or is my lack of blur actually secretly skeuomorphism??? The more you know.) and parallax. I am however very proud of my first ever dark-themed app. If Jony sees this app, make sure to say sorry to him. I tried my best and put in over 50 hours of work :D
